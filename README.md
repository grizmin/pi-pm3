# Proxmark3 Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
Did you ever thought how cool it will be if you can add network capabilities to yor cheap Proxmark3 easy?
You can do that relatively cheap using a RPi zero 2 w and external power. Both my pi0 and proxmark3easy are running for more than 5 hours on a 10000mah xiaomi power bank.   

All you need to do is boot from this image and enjoy using your pm3 over wifi.   

This image is configured to set up a wifi access point, and SSH, web bash shell and a web pm3 cli  
The default user credentials are - username: `dt` password: `proxmark3`


## usage
You can burn the image to a sd-card using https://etcher.balena.io/   
Insert the sd-card in your RPI Zero 2 w and power it on.   
Wait for one minute for the OS to boot and then connect to the Access Point using the following credentials
```
SSID: raspi-webgui
Password: ChangeMe
```

## AP management interface

## build

To build new image you should follow the steps below:
(Tested only on Apple Silicon macbook)

1. checkout pi-gen  
    ``` git clone https://github.com/RPi-Distro/pi-gen.git pmbuild ```
2. copy the content of pi-pm3 folder to pmbuild  
    ``` cp -rp pi-gen pmbuild/ ```
3. Checkout the arm64 branch of pi-gen  
    ``` cd pmbuild; git checkout arm64 ```
4. make sure you have a docker server running (or any of it's alternatives https://spacelift.io/blog/docker-alternatives)
5. start the build in a docker container   
   ``` ./docker-build.sh ```

On a successful build you should get something like the screenshot blow:
